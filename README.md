# GifTastic
HW 6- GifTastic
This app was created during week 6 of the UNC Coding Bootcamp.  The homework called for an app that returned GIFs (with a rating) on the click of a button.  It also required a form field where the user could create new buttons that would add to the array thus creating a new button.  I choose to make my app related to game of thrones families/characters because I never know who belongs to what family when watching the show and thought this might be a fun way to learn who is in which family.

Instructions
1)  Click on the button(s) to generate a GIF.
2)  Click on the GIF to start/stop the action.
3)  If you want to add supplemental buttons enter the button input into the form field and click the add button, then repeat steps above until your heart is content.
